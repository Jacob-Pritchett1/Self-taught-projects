# Beginner Problems

This repository is a collection of beginner projects as I navigate through Python. I am new to programming and chose Python as my first language due to the types of projects I can accomplish with it. 

Thanks for visiting!

UPDATE: I will continue to update this respository, but only will subjects or assignments that I solved on my own. Most of the content already in this repository were fundamental assignments from when I was self-taught. y most current projects/repositories are in my journal-application or coding bootcamp public.
